Configuration for mod_lisp
--------------------------

First of all, it is necessary to set up Apache mod_lisp on localhost.
You may want to add the following line to httpd.conf:
LispServer 127.0.0.1 8080 "Lunula"


Starting the server
-------------------

Run `env YPSILON_SITELIB="path to (uri)" make start',
then the server will start to wait for requests on the port 8080.


Stopping the server
-------------------

You have to kill the server's process by the TERM signal.
